            <h2>Healthy Tips</h2>
            <p>
                The Physical Activity Guidelines recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, 60 minutes for children, at least five days a week. Sound daunting? It's much easier than you think, regardless of your current activity level. There are plenty of ways to get moving and some may even surprise you! 
                  Look for ways to increase your heart rate during your daily routine. Walk or cycle instead of taking the car or bus, or you can choose the stairs over the escalator or elevator. Try these ways to be active and start working towards your fitness goals to jumpstart or maintain a healthy lifestyle.Good nutrition is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. Combined with physical activity, your diet can help you to reach and maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk of chronic diseases (like heart disease and cancer), and promote your overall health.
